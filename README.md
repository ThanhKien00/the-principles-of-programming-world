# The Principles of Programming World

Programming is an intricate and dynamic field that constantly evolves. As a Software Developer, it's crucial to adhere to certain 
principles that not only enhance the quality and efficiency of your code but also facilitate collaboration and maintainability.
This article is a compilation of some principles that every Software Developer should know. The list is incomplete, and sometimes trade-offs 
need to be made between conflicting principles. However, higher ranked principles usually beat lower ranked ones.

The list was inspired by <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->

## What are Programming Principles ?

Programming Principles are fundamental guidelines or rules that help guide the process of writing efficient, maintainable, and reliable software.

## Benefits of Programming Principles

- **Readability and Collaboration**  
- **Flexibility, Maintainability and Scalability**  
- **Modularity and Reliability**

## Common Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid !)

The KISS principle is about striving for simplicity, KISS states that a solution 
is better when it uses less inheritance, less polymorphism, fewer classes, ect.
This does not mean that features like inheritance or polymorphism should not be used at all.
Rather they should only be used when they are necessary or there's some substantial advantage.[1]
